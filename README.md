Based on *'Section 18: Diving into Redux (An Alternative To The Context API)'* of Academind's *['React - The Complete Guide'](https://acad.link/reactjs)* course, this repo has commits of examples of:

* Creating a Redux store (with `createStore()`) and "providing" it to our React app (with the `<Provider>` component imported from 'react-redux') - [Commit link](https://github.com/jro31/react-redux-demo/commit/1f5610919efee1280ba2e4d4e4fd6b8c32efa307)
* Using the `useSelector()` hook to setup a subscription to the Redux store, and using the store state in a React component ('Counter') - [Commit link](https://github.com/jro31/react-redux-demo/commit/816aef575214c518db7bbf171ac00fe523ea7eb7)
* Using the `useDispatch()` hook to "dispatch" actions from inside the 'Counter' component - [Commit link](https://github.com/jro31/react-redux-demo/commit/21570810a6ffc927bc477aced16e7d7f7c507cb3)
* Updating the 'Counter' component to be a class-based component that uses Redux, by using the `connect` import from 'react-redux', and by using `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps` - [Commit link](https://github.com/jro31/react-redux-demo/commit/3e1fc9a73fa37cb6bef7c9e49ca16cbc02488d7c)
* (Reverting it to be a functional component again - [Commit link](https://github.com/jro31/react-redux-demo/commit/afa977f84afdfed76760e2a6a1ddfc8ce3019cbd))
* Adding a 'payload' to an action to make the reducer dynamic - [Commit link](https://github.com/jro31/react-redux-demo/commit/93c6ae6f9e92caaaabbea6a358764a03f023b1b6)
* Adding a second state property (`showCounter`) and using this within the 'Counter' component - [Commit link](https://github.com/jro31/react-redux-demo/commit/96796d900bb8e5f73b06bf237463d6517a853c47)
* Updating the store to be created with **Redux Toolkit** (instead of Redux), including using `createSlice()` and `configureStore()`, and updating the 'Counter' component to work with this - [Commit link](https://github.com/jro31/react-redux-demo/commit/24354947157d9a0062275de7366ce6b34b98afba)
* Adding a second state slice ('auth'), and updating the 'Counter' component to still work with the initial 'counter' state slice (we don't yet use the 'auth' state slice anywhere) - [Commit link](https://github.com/jro31/react-redux-demo/commit/1d6aceb644a4f7aa72cf33a629c7c6f2ad1b4003)
* Using the 'auth' state slice to allow users to "login" in the 'Auth' component (not really login), and to "logout" in the 'Header' component, and to change what is displayed to the user depending on if they're logged-in or logged-out - [Commit link](https://github.com/jro31/react-redux-demo/commit/56c0e3055e9cc3fa5bee52a3c183f09e3301a7d4)
* Splitting the store into multiple files - [Commit link](https://github.com/jro31/react-redux-demo/commit/7823f4a8dcd85a4c717a0b9e6ef2ea81eb7ee2f0)
